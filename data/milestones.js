    description: `Before starting Thomson, Mr. Michael Lim took on the previous family business trading medicines to pharmacies. But during that period, he realised a potential trend that had yet to hit the Malaysian market, herbal supplements aka nutraceuticals. So in the year 1987, he started a supplement brand, by combining his father's name, Thomas, with himself as the "son" to create the name Thomson. \n \n The beginnings were humble, as we started in a little retail shop in Taman Tun Dr Ismail, Kuala Lumpur called The Honey Shop, selling all sorts of supplements and honey, including other brands as well. Mr. Michael and his wife, Mdm. Lynn would be working tirelessly in the back of the shop counting tablets and capsules manually or pouring honey into bottles. Mr. Michael, along with 2 other salesmen would also travel the whole Malaysia and Singapore, meeting pharmacies and medical halls to sell Thomson products.`,

    description: `During those early years, we would import tablets or capsules from overseas without too much attention paid to quality, then pack them manually to sell. But a major turning point came when one of Mr. Michael's close customers, a GP, refused to see him after buying some of our products. But after Mr. Michael probed him deeper, the doctor said "I trusted you, but you sold me rubbish!". That was a major turning point for Mr. Michael, as he began to realise how the quality of supplements significantly affected a product's effectiveness.`,

    description: `During a health ingredients exhibition, Mr. Michael discovered a new source of Ginkgo Biloba extract from Japan. This product was significantly higher in cost but had a special technology to improve its effectiveness. He took the plunge to replace his existing Ginkgo with this one. To his surprise, a lot of negative feedback arose, with customers complaining of the side effects of this new product, which caused a great deal of worry and confusion. But he later found out through some TCM doctors that when you have a good and effective product, it is common for side effects to arise.`,
